# Employee Data Manipulation and Salary Processing in Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates Python programming fundamentals through the manipulation of employee data and salary adjustments. It splits a list of employees into two sub-lists, updates the lists, and applies a 4% salary increase. The project showcases key skills in data manipulation and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Features
- Splitting a list of employee names into two sub-lists.
- Adding a new employee and removing one from the sub-lists.
- Merging the sub-lists into one final list.
- Adjusting employee salaries by 4% and sorting the salary list.
- Displaying the top three highest salaries.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming
- List manipulation (splitting, appending, deleting, and merging lists)
- Basic arithmetic operations (salary adjustments)
- Sorting and retrieving specific data from lists
- Problem-solving applied to real-world HR scenarios

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abansria/Employee-Data-Manipulation-Python/
